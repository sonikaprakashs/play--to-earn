Hello All, I am currently working on a research based on Play-to-earn The advent of the internet changed the gaming industry and created a whole new platform and technology for Game creators. The play-earn-concept business model allows gamers to trade in-game assets. The new blockchain gaming platform aims to help align developers and players and how they earn economically. It’s a business model that embraces the concept of an open economy and provides financial benefits to all players who add value by contributing to the game world. It’s likely to introduce new game concepts and retention models not yet seen in modern gaming.
